The WTWR App is designed to make choosing your clothes an easy task with regard to weather. 

Using React and JSX as the foundations, this app allows users to interact with an API in order to retrieve their current location, weather, and time.
With this information in mind then, the application presents users with a number of clothing options for appropriate for the the current climate and time day.
Additionally, it allows users to add their own clothing, enabling them to create a virtual wardrobe from which this application will pull, on top of the default values already given.
