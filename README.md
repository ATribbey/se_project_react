# WTWR (What to Wear?): Front End

This front-end project written for my WTWR application (see the link below for back-end express application) allows users to interact with an express server and database that saves users, clothing items, and other pieces of information pertaining to both of these items. The application makes heavy use of React, as well as other technologies such as react-router-dom.
